# Simplex Algorithm

## About 

The first practice assignment in the Linear Programming course was about building a simple version of the simplex algorithm. It receives a matrix and it's dimensions. After that it builds a Tableau and proceed pivoting the LP until finding the end of the algorithm (optimal conditional, unbounded conditional or inviable conditional). Covers both primal and dual simplex problems.

Runs in the form: "./run.sh < test-case >". Or manually interpret it calling python3, the main file (main.py) and all the others as suplementary files.

Coded in Python 3, uses Numpy and Fractions packages.
